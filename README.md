To design a weight control system for a container dedicated to grain storage. The container is provided with an opening for releasing the grain onto a conveyor belt.
Knowing that the weight sensor used can measure the weight linearly in the range of 15kg and 175kg, the system will be designed so that the weight of the container is maintained in the range of 10kg and 90kg. 
The weight sensor will bias current.
The linear variation of the electrical resistance of the weight sensor is between 45kΩ and 75kΩ and must be converted into a voltage variation in the range [0÷(Vcc-2V)] (Vcc=14V). 
The weight of the container is maintained within the specified range by means of a pump controlled by a comparator and an electromagnetic relay. 
The pump-relay assembly will be modeled using a resistor. The state of the pump (on/off) is signaled by a green LED.
